# d-delaunay

D-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in Rust, inspired by [CGAL].

## Introduction

This library implements d-dimensional Delaunay triangulations and CGAL-like features in Rust. It is inspired by the [CGAL] library, which is a C++ library for computational geometry; and [Spade], a Rust library implementing 2D Delaunay triangulations, Constrained Delaunay triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams. The eventual goal of this library is to provide a lightweight Rust alternative to [CGAL].
